# Chocolatey Install:


1.  First, ensure that you are using an  **_[administrative shell](https://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-8.1/)_**  - you can also install as a non-admin, check out  [Non-Administrative Installation](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup#non-administrative-install).
2.  Install with powershell.exe
    
    **NOTE:**  Please inspect  [https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1](https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1)  prior to running any of these scripts to ensure safety. We already know it's safe, but you should verify the security and contents of  **_any_**  script from the internet you are not familiar with. All of these scripts download a remote PowerShell script and execute it on your machine. We take security very seriously.  [Learn more about our security protocols](https://chocolatey.org/security).
    
    With PowerShell, you must ensure  [Get-ExecutionPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170)  is not Restricted. We suggest using  `Bypass`  to bypass the policy to get things installed or  `AllSigned`  for quite a bit more security.
    
    -   Run  `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. If it returns  `Restricted`, then run  `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned`  or  `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`.
    
    Now run the following command:

```javascript

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```  
    
3.  Paste the copied text into your shell and press Enter.
4.  Wait a few seconds for the command to complete.
5.  If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Chocolatey! Type  `choco`  or  `choco -?`  now, or see  [Getting Started](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/getting-started)  for usage instructions.
